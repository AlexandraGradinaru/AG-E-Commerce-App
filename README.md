# AG E-Commerce-App
E-Commerce App Frontend developed using HTML5, CSS3, SASS and JavaScript. The layout was designed using Figma software. The project is still in the development phase, as it has just recently been started, and it will be updated constantly. The purpose is to extend my web developing skills and to create a better app as I learn new technologies and CSS methodologies. For the moment, PHP is used only for importing the necessary files. Changes will be made during the development.
